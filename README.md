# Introduction
Websites are created using three different languages:
1. HTML - A markup language that defines the *structure* of a webpage
2. CSS - A styling language that determines colors, fonts, et cetera
3. JavaScript - A scripting language; this describes how the website should *function*
# Organizing Files
For now, we will keep all three languages in one file, but as things
get more complicated, we'll have to worry about organization more.
# Learning Resources
These websites contain everything you will ever need to know. I generally
prefer the first one for HTML and CSS, and the second for JavaScript.

# Miscellaneous
## This File
This is called a README file. They're often just txt files, but this 
one is in Markdown, which is a markup language like HTML, designed for
basic things like this. Lots of websites used by programmers have 
Markdown renderers built in.
## Version Control
Version control programs let you take snapshots of your work and help 
you keep a log, so that you (or others) can always pick projects back 
up where you left off.

Version control programs also help multiple people collaborate on a 
single project by keeping track of who changed each line of code and
when, so that we won't accidentally overwrite each other's changes.

We are using a version control program called Git, and we are using 
the hosting platform GitHub as a centralized repository for our changes.

Try running `git log` to see what I've done so far.
## This is a post-receive hook test!
This allows me to deploy with a single command! It's really nice.
But there are complexities regarding the $PATH variable and other user things.
SO many things can go wrong, but I think we're nearly there
The 5th time's the charm, hopefully.
